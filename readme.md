## Background

Thanks for taking the time to check out my repo! My name is Jon, I'm a 27 year-old aspiring web developer from Denver Colorado. This project was made following the tutorial in the link below, and then I optimized it for mobile, added my github link and stylized it a little bit more. The objective is primarily to solidify my JavaScript fundamentals before jumping back into React.
